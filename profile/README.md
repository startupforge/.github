# Startup Forge

This is a guide about what I've learned creating a startup. Mostly the technical bits. Hopefully you find it helpful!

# Setup Domain & Email

- [ ] Come up with a name. It doesn't have to be perfect.
  - Check the name's availability to buy as a domain and on other sites like GitHub before proceeding too far.
- [ ] Buy the domain like `startupforge.dev`.
  - Register it under an account outside the domain, like startupforge@gmail.com, or a personal account.
  - [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) is a solid domain registrar, but there are plenty of other good options.
- [ ] Create a [Google workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) account with the new domain.
  - Follow Google's onboarding instructions to eventually setup the domain to receieve email. You will likely need to update TXT records to verify you own the domain, and MX records to route emails appropriately.
- [ ] Login to your email and make sure it works.

_Note: Make sure the account used with the domain registrar and Google workspaces is properly secure. They are the master keys to almost everything we will set up._

# Next Steps
