# Startup Forge

This is a guide about what I've learned creating a startup. Mostly the technical bits. Hopefully you find it helpful!

# Steps

1. Get a domain, like startupforge.dev. It doesn't have to be perfect.
  - Register it under an account outside the domain, like startupforge@gmail.com, or a personal account.
  - I use namecheap.
2. Setup azure & google workspace.
4. Setup github org.
